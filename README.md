# Data-Visualization-Master-Credit-Card-Dashboard
This project is the result of the MySkill bootcamp themed "Data Visualization with Looker Studio", focusing on visualizing company requests effectively. This project aims to visualize data through a dashboard that allows the company to identify customers with potential default risks. The dashboard is designed to provide a clear overview of customer risk profiles, enabling the company to monitor high-risk customers and take necessary preventive measures. With interactively presented information, the company can easily make decisions to address payment issues, such as adjusting credit limits or issuing early warnings, to avoid potential defaults.
